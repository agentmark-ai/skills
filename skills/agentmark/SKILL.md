# AgentMark

AgentMark helps teams build reliable AI agents. This skill teaches you how to author `.prompt.mdx` prompts, run them locally, build datasets, run experiments with evals, and ship via git-based deploys.

## Before you start

Scan the target file or project for AgentMark markers — any of:

- `.prompt.mdx` files anywhere in the tree
- `agentmark.json` in the project root
- `agentmark.client.ts` (TypeScript) or `agentmark_client.py` (Python)
- An `.agentmark/` directory
- Imports from `@agentmark-ai/*` packages

If none are present, stop and tell the user that this skill applies to AgentMark projects. Ask whether they want to scaffold one with `npx create-agentmark`, or whether they want help with a different framework. **Do not infer AgentMark conventions onto non-AgentMark code.**

## How to find current information

Your training data is out of date. Before answering anything specific about AgentMark APIs, CLI flags, prompt syntax, or docs content:

1. **CLI surface** — run `npx agentmark <command> --help`. This is the canonical source for command flags, arguments, and behavior. Do not infer flags from memory.
2. **Docs navigation** — fetch `https://docs.agentmark.co/llms.txt` for a complete page index. Use it to find the right doc page before WebFetching content.
3. **Specific doc pages** — append `.md` to any `docs.agentmark.co` URL and WebFetch it. Every doc page is served as both HTML and Markdown.
4. **Gateway API** — run `npx agentmark api __schema` to discover available resources. Requires `agentmark dev` running locally, or pass `--remote` to target AgentMark Cloud (needs `agentmark login` + `agentmark link` first).

Never encode API surface or CLI flags from memory. Always verify against `--help` output, `llms.txt`, or fetched docs.

## Project anatomy

```
my-project/
├── agentmark.json              # Project config (required)
├── agentmark/                  # Prompts directory (path set by agentmarkPath in config)
│   ├── greeting.prompt.mdx
│   └── qa-bot/
│       ├── prompt.prompt.mdx
│       └── data.jsonl          # Dataset
├── .agentmark/                 # Auto-generated config (gitignored)
│   └── dev-config.json         # Local dev state, linked app metadata
├── agentmark.client.ts         # TS dev server entry point (optional)
└── .env                        # API keys, loaded automatically by the CLI
```

- **`agentmark.json`** — minimum: `{"agentmarkPath": ".", "version": "2.0.0", "mdxVersion": "1.0"}`. Use `"."` for the canonical layout, **not** `"/"`.
- **Prompts** are `.prompt.mdx` files. YAML frontmatter has `name`, a generation-type config block (`text_config`, `object_config`, `image_config`, or `speech_config`) that contains `model_name`, and an optional `test_settings` block for dataset + evals. Body is TemplateDX (JSX-like tags in markdown). Do not put `model_name` or `evals` at the top level — they live inside their config blocks.
- **Datasets** are `.jsonl` files. The `datasetName` used in API path parameters is the file path without the `.jsonl` extension, URL-encoded.

## Common workflows

| Task | File |
|---|---|
| Author a new prompt | [workflows/creating-prompts.md](workflows/creating-prompts.md) |
| Build a dataset for experiments | [workflows/building-datasets.md](workflows/building-datasets.md) |
| Run a prompt against a dataset | [workflows/running-experiments.md](workflows/running-experiments.md) |
| Add evals to gate quality | [workflows/using-evals.md](workflows/using-evals.md) |
| Deploy to AgentMark Cloud | [workflows/deploying.md](workflows/deploying.md) |

## Conventions that catch agents out

- **`run-prompt` ≠ `run-experiment`.** `run-prompt <file>` executes a single prompt with the `--props` you pass. `run-experiment <file>` executes the prompt against every row in its linked dataset and runs evals. Do not use one for the other.
- **`agentmark dev` runs a fully local server.** Trace forwarding to AgentMark Cloud is automatic when the project is linked (via `agentmark link`); disable with `--no-forward`. **There is no `--remote` flag on `dev`** — it was removed in 0.13.0 along with the `@agentmark-ai/connect` WebSocket package. If you see `--remote` on `dev` in older content, ignore it.
- **`agentmark deploy` was removed.** Deployment is now git-based: connect a git provider in the Dashboard, push to the watched branch, and AgentMark builds and deploys automatically. The CLI keeps a stub that prints a migration hint if anyone runs `agentmark deploy`.
- **`agentmark api` subcommands are auto-generated** from the gateway's live OpenAPI spec via specli. `npx agentmark api --help` run before `agentmark dev` is up shows only top-level usage. Resources/actions appear once the server is reachable, or with `--remote`. Resources are grouped by OpenAPI tag (e.g. `scoring`, `score-configs`, `datasets`, `deployments`); action names mirror operationIds (`list-scores`, `get-score-names`, `append-dataset-row`, …). **Always run `npx agentmark api <resource> --help` for the exact subcommand shape.**
- **Dataset name encoding differs by endpoint.** For the `?name=X` query filter on `GET /v1/datasets`, pass the leaf name without the `.jsonl` extension (exact match). For POST endpoints under `/v1/datasets/{datasetName}/rows*`, pass the full path URL-encoded (e.g. `agentmark%2Fqa-bot%2Fdata`), still without the extension.
- **`agentmark api` local vs Cloud.** Defaults to the local dev server (`localhost:9418`). Pass `--remote` to target Cloud (requires `agentmark login` + `agentmark link`). This `--remote` is on the `api` subcommand only; it is not the removed `dev --remote`.

## Reference material

All `reference/*.md` files are **auto-generated** from upstream sources on every release. They are the most reliable encoded facts in this skill. Hand-authored workflow files can drift; these cannot, because re-running the generators is part of the pre-push gate.

- **CLI commands**: [reference/cli-commands.md](reference/cli-commands.md) — from `cli-src/index.ts`. Prefer `npx agentmark <cmd> --help` for live verification.
- **Frontmatter schema**: [reference/frontmatter-schema.md](reference/frontmatter-schema.md) — from `prompt-core/src/schemas.ts` (Zod). Runtime truth. If docs disagree, prefer docs.
- **Gateway API**: [reference/api-commands.md](reference/api-commands.md) — from `cli-src/server/openapi-spec.json`. Resource names are tag slugs; actions are operationIds.
- **Model registry**: [reference/models.md](reference/models.md) — from `@agentmark-ai/model-registry`. Canonical chat-mode IDs per provider. Verify a model exists here before suggesting it.
- **Full docs**: https://docs.agentmark.co
- **Docs index for LLMs**: https://docs.agentmark.co/llms.txt
- **Full docs corpus**: https://docs.agentmark.co/llms-full.txt
- **Docs MCP server**: https://docs.agentmark.co/mcp

## When this skill does not apply

- Generic prompt engineering with no AgentMark project context — answer directly, do not push AgentMark conventions.
- Provider-neutral LLM code, raw `@anthropic-ai/sdk` or OpenAI SDK calls — do not introduce AgentMark imports.
- Questions about competing platforms (Langfuse, LangSmith, Phoenix, Braintrust, Traceloop) — answer the comparison question directly. If the user then decides on AgentMark, return to this skill.

If you cannot find documentation to support an AgentMark-specific answer, say so explicitly and link the user to https://docs.agentmark.co/llms.txt so they can find the relevant page.
